# NYT Games Replica - Proto.io UI Project
A high-fidelity user interface replica of the New York Times Games mobile application, built using Proto.io to demonstrate advanced prototyping and UI design capabilities.

## Project Overview
This project showcases the recreation of the NYT Games app interface, focusing on core UI/UX principles and interactive design patterns. The replica demonstrates proficiency in modern prototyping tools and attention to detail in interface design. *Note that the js code in this project was not actually written by me but rather is the code running the Proto.io application.

### Project Goals
- UI Design Mastery: Demonstrate ability to recreate complex, real-world interfaces with accuracy using modern design tools
- Proto.io Proficiency: Showcase advanced features of Proto.io including nested containers, scrolling, and interactions
- User Experience Focus: Implement intuitive navigation patterns and responsive design elements
- Interactive Prototyping: Create functional prototypes that simulate real app behavior

### Project Scope and Limitations
#### Project Focus & Scope
This prototype specifically focuses on the home screen dashboard of the NYT Games app, emphasizing the main games discovery and navigation interface.

#### Included Features
- Main games dashboard interface
- Multi-directional scrolling functionality
- Interactive game selection
  - Core games presentation (Crossword, Spelling Bee, Wordle, Connections)
- Navigation between screens
- Responsive layout components

#### Intentional Exclusions: 
*This project demonstrates mastery of home screen UI design and complex layout management rather than comprehensive app development. The focus on the dashboard interface allows for deep exploration of Proto.io's container and scrolling capabilities.*
- Individual game interfaces: No gameplay screens or game-specific UI elements
- Complete games catalog: Limited to 4 main games rather than the full NYT Games library
- Secondary screens: Profile, settings, achievements, and other app sections
- Game logic and playability: Focus on interface design rather than functional games
- User authentication systems: No login/signup flows
- Backend data integration: Static content presentation
- Advanced animations: Emphasis on core scrolling and navigation over micro-interactions

### Core Interface Elements
- Game Grid Layout: Organized display of different NYT games (Crossword, Spelling Bee, Wordle, Connections)
- Visual Hierarchy: Proper typography, spacing, and color schemes matching the original design
- Interactive Game Cards: Clickable game tiles with hover states and visual feedback

### Proto.io Features Utilized
- Container System: Nested scrollable containers for complex layouts
  - Primary vertical scrolling for overall page navigation
  - Secondary horizontal scrolling within individual game rows
- State Transitions: Screen-to-screen navigation with smooth animations
  - Implemented inertia and boundary settings for natural feel
- Touch Gestures: Swipe and tap interactions throughout the interface
- Responsive Design: Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes

## Viewing the Prototype
1. Visit the live demo: https://aghedden.github.io/proto.io_project/nyt_game_replica_fullscreen.html
2. For best experience: View on mobile device or use browser developer tools to switch to mobile view
3. Test vertical scrolling: Scroll up and down through the different game sections
4. Test horizontal scrolling: Swipe left and right within each game row (Crossword, Spelling Bee, Wordle, Connections)

## Code Disclaimer
The JavaScript code in this repository was auto-generated by Proto.io during the HTML export process. I did not write the underlying JavaScript, CSS animations, or interactive functionality code. The exported code serves as a functional demonstration of the design work completed in Proto.io, but should not be considered as evidence of custom JavaScript development skills. My contributions were:
- UI/UX Design: Creating the visual interface and layout in Proto.io
- Interaction Design: Defining user flows, scrolling behavior, and screen states
- Content Organization: Structuring the information architecture and game presentation
- Prototyping Logic: Setting up containers, transitions, and interactive elements within Proto.io
